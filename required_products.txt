#
# PadoGrid bundle environment. This bundle requires the product versions listed below.
# Note that the required product versions listed in the file override the product
# versions that make up the bundle name.
#
# Specify ony the version number parts that are required. For example, if the bundle
# can be run on all versions of Geode 1.x.x, then specify 1 only. If it applies to
# 1.1.x, then 1.1. If the bundle applies to multiple specific versions, then list them
# comma-separated. For example, the following applies to Geode 1.12.2 and 1.13.x
#
# geode=1.12.2,1.13.x
#
# To deemphasize products, i.e., product not required, requires multiple products, etc.,
# then set none=1.
